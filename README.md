# Mapping Malasaña neighborhood in Madrid

Small project to clean, process and visualize OpenStreetMap curated data on the Madrid neighborhood of Malasaña.

Geometries are downloaded from https://www.geofabrik.de/, a great project in cooperation with OSM aiming to create a freely usable world map.

I downloaded whole Spain excerpt on May 2020. Unless major changes will occurr on OSM and GeoFabrik layering specifications, you should be able to reproduce my plots easily (I did not uploaded data in this repo tough).

If you want more details feel free to reach out!
